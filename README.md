**Simple, Fast, Privacy-Friendly Image Editor for Web**

imgStyler is a minimalistic, intuitive, and entirely browser-based image editor designed to quickly prepare your images for online use. Built specifically to simplify common tasksâ€”cropping, applying filters, adjustments, and exportingâ€”it lets you rapidly enhance and optimize images without complex software or uploads.

## Key Features

### ðŸš€ Simple, Intuitive Interface
- Quickly crop images using freeform selection or handy social media presets.

- Instantly preview and select from built-in artistic filters such as Vintage, Grayscale, Noir, Sepia, and Sketch.

### ðŸŽ¯ Optimized for Online Use
- Export in popular formats (PNG, JPEG, WebP, TIFF).
- Customize image quality, resize dimensions, and choose lossless or lossy compression.

### ðŸ”’ Completely Local & Private
- All image processing happens in your web browser using JavaScript.
- No data or images are ever uploaded to a serverâ€”your files stay private.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Clone this repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/dev4pgh/imgstyler-astro.git
cd imgstyler-astro
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to the local URL provided.

### Optional: Setting Up Analytics (Umami)

This project includes integration for [Umami](https://umami.is/), a privacy-focused web analytics solution. Analytics data is only sent if you configure the necessary environment variables.

1.  **Create a `.env` file:** Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env` in the project root:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2.  **Edit `.env`:** Replace the placeholder values in the new `.env` file with your own Umami instance details:
    * `UMAMI_SCRIPT_URL`: The full URL to your Umami `script.js` file (e.g., `https://your-umami-instance.com/script.js`).
    * `UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID`: The unique Website ID provided by your Umami instance for this site.

3.  **Restart Dev Server:** If the development server (`npm run dev`) was already running, stop it (`Ctrl+C`) and restart it to load the new environment variables.

4.  **Deployment:** For analytics to work on your deployed site, you must also configure these same `UMAMI_SCRIPT_URL` and `UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID` environment variables in your hosting provider's settings.


### Usage

1. **Upload an image**: Drag and drop or select a file.
2. **Crop**: Choose presets or custom aspect ratios.
3. **Apply Adjustments & Filters**: Enhance your image to your liking.
4. **Export**: Choose format, quality, and dimensions, then download.
