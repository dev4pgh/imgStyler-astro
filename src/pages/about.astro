    <p class="mb-4">
      imgStyler was created to provide a simple, fast, and free way to perform common image editing tasks
      directly in the web browser without needing to install software or upload your images to a server.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Our goal is to offer essential tools like cropping, filtering, and color adjustments in an intuitive
      interface. We prioritize user privacy by processing images entirely on the client-side using
      JavaScript and the Canvas API.
